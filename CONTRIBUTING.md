## ✨ Code Style & Standards

### Python Code Standards

**🐍 PEP 8 Compliance**

We follow PEP 8 with some project-specific adaptations:

* **Line length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black formatter default)
* **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
* **Imports**: Grouped and alphabetically sorted
* **Docstrings**: Required for all public functions and classes

**📝 Code Documentation**

```python
def calculate_fine(due_date: datetime, return_date: datetime, 
                  daily_rate: float = 0.50) -> float:
    """
    Calculate library fine based on overdue days.
    
    Args:
        due_date: Original due date for the book
        return_date: Actual return date
        daily_rate: Fine amount per day (default: $0.50)
        
    Returns:
        Total fine amount as float
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If return_date is before due_date
        
    Example:
        >>> from datetime import datetime
        >>> due = datetime(2025, 1, 1)
        >>> returned = datetime(2025, 1, 5)
        >>> calculate_fine(due, returned)
        2.0
    """
    if return_date < due_date:
        raise ValueError("Return date cannot be before due date")
    
    overdue_days = (return_date - due_date).days
    return max(0, overdue_days * daily_rate)
```

**🔒 Security Best Practices**

```python
# ✅ Good: Input sanitization
def search_books(query: str) -> List[Dict]:
    # Sanitize input to prevent SQL injection
    safe_query = security_manager.sanitize_input(query)
    return database.search_books(safe_query)

# ✅ Good: Secure password handling
def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    hashed_password = get_user_password_hash(username)
    return security_manager.verify_password(password, hashed_password)

# ❌ Bad: Direct database queries
def search_books_bad(query: str):
    # Never do this - vulnerable to SQL injection
    return database.execute(f"SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%{query}%'")
```

### Frontend Code Standards

**🎨 Streamlit UI Guidelines**

```python
# ✅ Good: Consistent layout structure
def render_dashboard():
    st.title("📊 Library Dashboard")
    
    # Use columns for organized layout
    col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
    
    with col1:
        st.metric("Total Books", total_books, delta=new_books_this_month)
    
    with col2:
        st.metric("Active Loans", active_loans, delta=loans_today)
    
    with col3:
        st.metric("Overdue Items", overdue_items, delta=-returned_today)

# ✅ Good: Error handling in UI
def add_book_form():
    with st.form("add_book"):
        isbn = st.text_input("ISBN", help="10 or 13 digit ISBN")
        title = st.text_input("Title", max_chars=200)
        
        if st.form_submit_button("Add Book"):
            try:
                if not isbn or not title:
                    st.error("ISBN and Title are required fields")
                    return
                
                book_id = add_book_to_database(isbn, title)
                st.success(f"Book added successfully! ID: {book_id}")
                
            except Exception as e:
                st.error(f"Error adding book: {str(e)}")
                logger.error(f"Add book error: {e}")
```

### Database Standards

**🗄️ SQL Best Practices**

```python
# ✅ Good: Parameterized queries
def get_user_books(user_id: int) -> List[Dict]:
    query = """
        SELECT b.title, b.author, br.due_date, br.status
        FROM books b
        JOIN borrowings br ON b.id = br.book_id
        WHERE br.user_id = ?
        ORDER BY br.due_date ASC
    """
    return database.fetch_all(query, (user_id,))

# ✅ Good: Transaction handling
def transfer_book(from_user_id: int, to_user_id: int, book_id: int):
    with database.transaction():
        # Return book from first user
        database.execute(
            "UPDATE borrowings SET status = 'returned' WHERE user_id = ? AND book_id = ?",
            (from_user_id, book_id)
        )
        
        # Create new borrowing for second user
        database.execute(
            "INSERT INTO borrowings (user_id, book_id, status) VALUES (?, ?, 'active')",
            (to_user_id, book_id)
        )
```

### Code Formatting Tools

**🛠️ Automated Formatting**

```bash
# Install development tools
pip install black flake8 isort mypy

# Format code with Black
black litgrid.py

# Check style with flake8
flake8 litgrid.py --max-line-length=88

# Sort imports with isort
isort litgrid.py

# Type checking with mypy
mypy litgrid.py --ignore-missing-imports
```

2. **Integration Tests** (20%): Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests** (10%): Test complete user workflows

### Unit Testing

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class TestLibraryFunctions(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures before each test method."""
        self.sample_book = {
            'id': 1,
            'title': 'Test Book',
            'author': 'Test Author',
            'isbn': '1234567890'
        }
    
    def test_calculate_fine_no_overdue(self):
        """Test fine calculation for on-time return."""
        due_date = datetime.now()
        return_date = due_date - timedelta(days=1)  # Returned early
        
        fine = calculate_fine(due_date, return_date)
        self.assertEqual(fine, 0.0)
    
    def test_calculate_fine_overdue(self):
        """Test fine calculation for overdue return."""
        due_date = datetime.now()
        return_date = due_date + timedelta(days=3)  # 3 days overdue
        
        fine = calculate_fine(due_date, return_date, daily_rate=1.0)
        self.assertEqual(fine, 3.0)
    
    @patch('litgrid.database.fetch_one')
    def test_get_book_by_id(self, mock_fetch):
        """Test book retrieval by ID."""
        mock_fetch.return_value = self.sample_book
        
        book = get_book_by_id(1)
        
        self.assertEqual(book['title'], 'Test Book')
        mock_fetch.assert_called_once_with(
            "SELECT * FROM books WHERE id = ?", (1,)
        )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Integration Testing

```python
import tempfile
import os
from litgrid import Database, LibraryManager

class TestLibraryIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        """Create temporary database for testing."""
        self.test_db = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
        self.db_path = self.test_db.name
        self.test_db.close()
        
        # Initialize test database
        self.database = Database(self.db_path)
        self.library = LibraryManager(self.database)
    
    def tearDown(self):

## 🔒 Security Considerations

Security is paramount in library management systems that handle sensitive patron data.

### Security Guidelines for Contributors

**🛡️ Secure Coding Practices**

* **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
* **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries exclusively
* **XSS Protection**: Escape output and validate HTML content
* **Authentication**: Implement secure session management
* **Authorization**: Enforce role-based access controls
* **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

**🔐 Data Protection**

* **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
* **Password Security**: Use strong hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)
* **Session Management**: Implement secure session handling with timeouts
* **Access Logging**: Log security-relevant events for audit trails
* **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store necessary data

### Security Review Process

**🔍 Security Checklist for Pull Requests**

* [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
* [ ] SQL queries use parameterization
* [ ] Sensitive data is properly encrypted
* [ ] Authentication and authorization checks are in place
* [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
* [ ] Logging captures security events appropriately
* [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and vulnerability-free

**⚠️ Reporting Security Issues**

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

**Instead:**

1. Email security reports to: [labib-x@protonmail.com](mailto:labib-x@protonmail.com)
2. Include detailed vulnerability information
3. Provide proof-of-concept if applicable
4. Allow time for coordinated disclosure

**📋 Security Testing**

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
pip audit

# Static code analysis
bandit -r litgrid.py

# Check for hardcoded secrets
truffleHog --regex --entropy=False .
```
