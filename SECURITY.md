###  Security Measures in Place

LitGrid is built with secure practices in mind, including:

- **OAuth 2.0 integration** (via Google Account)

- **XSS Protection** in custom HTML dialogs
- **Fine-grained permission model** (Sheets, Scripts)
- **Access control** for sensitive sheets and scripts
- **Auto-logout** and session expiration after inactivity (script-timed)
